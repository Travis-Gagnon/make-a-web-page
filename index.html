        <h3>Web Basics</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        The web consists of four major components:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer/Browser: What a user, like you, may use to surf the web</li>
          <li>Internet: A complex network of connected computers</li>
          <li>Servers: A set of computers that are optimized for file storage and recall</li>
          <li>HTTP: A language format that is used to express data over the internet; essentially the language of the world wide web</li>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertest Markup Language</em> and is the primary document type that is used on the internet. HTML is made of up of text (which is the text you see), markup (which is how that text looks on the screen), other documents (such
          as picture or video), and links to other pages (like <a href="http://www.udacity.com">this example</a>).

        <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          HTML documents are comprised of HTML Elements, which utilize HTML tags to tell the computer what you wish it to do and how you wish text and documents to be displayed. For instance, you can tell the computer to display the text as <b>bold</b>          or <em>italicized</em> just by providing the appropriate tags in the appropriate locations. Tags can also be used to link other webpages or display videos or images (likely of cats).

        <h3>Inline vs. Block</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          These tags can be inline or block. Inline tags will just display the contained contents inline with the surrounding text. However, a block element will create an invisible box around the content contained within that tag.

        <h3>Creating a More Structured Document</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are both languages used to create webpages. While we learned that HTML is the main language used to add content and structure to a webpage, CSS is a language that controls the style of what is displayed. CSS can change the font size and color,
          background color, and add borders and margins to displayed files and blocks of text. In fact, CSS can make pages consisting of identical HTML look drastically different from each other.

        <h3>Tree-like Structure</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          HTML files are organized into a tree-like structure that makes stylizing the page less redundant with CSS. This structure is referred to as "DOM" or <em>Document Object Model</em>. The tree like structure is a result of HTML elements having
          other elements within them. One can think of this as elements "branching out" with other sub-divisonal elements much like the trunk of a tree splits into smaller branches (and perhaps again smaller branches).

        <h3>Internet as a Universe of Boxes</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Any internet page can be thought of as a series of boxes that can be arranged in various ways to suit the needs of the developer. These boxes, which are made up of elements like those mentioned above, are more easily organized and arranged then HTML without
          any coherent organization.

        <h3>Adding CSS to Create Style</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          CSS, or <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em>, is used to apply stylistic effect to an HTML document. The word "cascading" is important because it implies how these CSS rules will shape the final result. CSS will apply to a specific HTML element, but
          also to all of all that element's child elements as well. This is known as "inheritance" and makes applying sweeping stylistic changes easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, order does matter in CSS. The order with which the rules are applied can affect the outcome. Rules that are stated later in the list will override previous definitions. This allows one to make alter the style of the more specific child elements
          and negate the "cascading" effect of CSS if they choose.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          CSS selectors allows a programmer to choose a specific "class" of content that they wish to alter and it will be done more easily, and with less redundancy, than it could be done within the HTML file. A selector could be something like an <b>h3</b>          or <b>div class</b> tag. CSS will then apply a property, such as "font-weight" or "background-color", and a value, such as "bold" or "yellow" respectively, to all elements that match that selector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, this <em>could</em> be done in HTML, but makes the work much more repetitive and time-consuming. Using CSS and structured HTML helps make everything easier.
